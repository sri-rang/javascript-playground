=====

A higher order function forEach is created which takes two parameters:
* a list
* a function that is to operate on each list item

Two examples of forEach's usage:
* first case involves passing a list listOfThings and a predefined function logItem
  * "logItem" is called for each item in "listOfThings"
* second case is similar except an anonymous function is created and passed instead of logItem
